# Twitter Display
## Bea Casey, Nick Caravias, Justin Schaumberger and Andrew Lee

For our CSCI479 senior design culminating project, we are creating a webpage that will display tweets to the computer science community at Bucknell. Certain professors who wish to have certain tweets shown will be displayed on the board if they use a hashtag, and other accounts such as ACM, ACM-W, and IEEE will be displayed. The website features a slow automatic scroll and automatically pulls new tweets everyday.   
 

Please enjoy our comprehensive and descriptive commit messages.
